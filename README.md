A program to simulate the population of a wild rabbit colony. bunnies breed and die depending on their age and infected status. The attributes of the bunnies are determined randomely when the bunny is born. The program ends when there are no bunnies remaining.

Objectives met:
The program meets the minumum requirements of the project outline.
I have also automated the process such that there are two second intervals between the list of bunnies being refreshed and a one second pause between annoucements.

Current objectives:
I have started a feature branch, with the aim of giving the user the option of removing half of the bunnies manually.
