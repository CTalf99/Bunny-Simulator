A program to simulate the population of a wild rabbit colony.

About the program:

Rabbit's are randomly assigned a name, sex, colour and the possibility of being 'infected' at birth.
The program is initialised with 5 rabbits, each turn the rabbits breed and become one year older.
As long as there is one adult (>2 years old) male, a new rabbit will be born for each adult female. However, infected rabbits do not participate in breeding.
A normal rabbit will die when they are more than ten years old, except infected rabbit's that live until age fifty.
Each turn the new list of bunnies is printed along with messages notifying the user of new births and rabbit deaths.
If the population exceeds 1000, a famine occurs and half of the rabbit population dies at random.
The program terminates when there are no rabbit's remaining.
