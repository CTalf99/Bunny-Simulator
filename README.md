A program to simulate the population of a wild rabbit colony. Bunnies breed and die depending on their age, sex and infected status. The attributes of the bunnies are determined randomly when the bunny is born. The program ends when there are no bunnies remaining.

Objectives met:
The program meets the minumum requirements specified in the project outline.
There are two second intervals between the list of bunnies being refreshed and a one second pause between annoucements.
Ability for user to half the population of the colony using 'k' input, in the two second window after list has been displayed.

Current objectives:
Due to the length of time it takes to run the program, I have not run the program to completion as many times as I would have liked. 
I am working on changing the parameters to speed this up for the purpose of fault finding. 
Although it doesn't break the program, the program currently accepts user input at all times despite only carrying out the 'kill half' command at the desired timing. I would like to resolve this so that it does not always take user input.
Trying to improve the code in main.cpp so that it is clearer and Bunny class/userInput aren't global.
