A program to simulate the population of a wild rabbit colony. Bunnies breed and die depending on their age, sex and infected status. The attributes of the bunnies are determined randomly when the bunny is born. The program ends when there are no bunnies remaining.

Objectives met:

The program meets the minumum requirements specified in the project outline.
There are two second intervals between the list of bunnies being refreshed and a one second pause between annoucements.

Current objectives:

I was in the process of allowing user input for manually removing half of the bunnies from the list. I did get this working to an extent but my implementation of it was buggy and it overcomplicated the main.cpp file so I decided to remove the feature. 
I could try to put this feature back in when I have a greater undertanding of threads.
